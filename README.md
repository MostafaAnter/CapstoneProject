#Key Considerations

###How will your app handle data persistence? 

All the data in the application is sore in a local repository using SQlite. A content provider will be use to connect the local repository with main application. Main entity is news item.

###Describe any corner cases in the UX.

A widget will provide news information to users, when use tab on the widget it will open the application will open detail activity to show user all information and allow user to share news detail with his friends.

###Describe any libraries youâ€™ll be using and share your reasoning for including them.

Retrofit :  to make the http calls.
Butterknife : simply to reduce boilerplate code in my application by inject views (or setting click listeners).

###Describe how you will implement Google Play Services.

Google Ads by integrate the Firebase libraries with adMob id.
